To compile: javac *.java
To run: java Main
To use: Use the mouse and click on a plot to select it, or toggle through the plots using the WASD keys. It will be outlined in green once it is selected. Use the buttons to plant, water, and fertilize your plants in each plot. All plant growth occurs overnight. When you have finished completing actions for the day, click "next day" to prompt the game to advance. If a plant's water level reaches 0 or exceeds 5, it will die. Each day the water level will decrease by one, so make sure to water your plants every day, or water them multiple times in one day. Once the flowers bloom and the vegetables appear ripe, they are ready to be harvested. When you click the harvest button the plant is removed from the plot (flowers) or the fruit disappears (vegetables) and "sold" so your money increases. You can continue to water and grow vegetables several times after harvesting the fruit. If you fertilize a plant, there is a 50% chance of the harvest yield being increased to two items instead of one (i.e. you get double the money). Flowers will be removed after the first harvest, but vegetables will be removed after several harvests (a random number between 2 and 5). The program only runs for 30 days, but you can do as many actions as you want each day. Various error messages pop up if you attempt prohibited actions. For example, you cannot plant two plants in the same plot and you cannot water an empty plot. You can save your progress in a file by typing a file name into the "Save As:" text field. You can later open that file by typing the file name into the "Restore a file:" text field. (NOTE: you do not need to type .txt unless you named the file with .txt, so if you save a file called "my game" just type "my game" into the reload text field). We already made files called initialConfig (this one is the initial setUp) and example. If you type those into the restore: textfield they will load, but you can save your own too.
